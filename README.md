## Project Overview

**modmixx** is a web-based platform designed to foster creativity and collaboration among music makers of all skill levels. It provides a safe, inclusive space where users can share unfinished ideas, learn from others, and build meaningful connections. The platform prioritises creativity over perfection and community over competition, offering an alternative to traditional self-promotion-focused platforms.

## Purpose, Industry Context and Objectives

The music industry is undergoing significant transformation, presenting both challenges and opportunities for independent artists. With declining revenue from streaming platforms and the rise of AI-generated content, original, human-made music risks being undervalued. Despite these shifts, the demand for creativity, connection, and community in music remains as strong as ever.

Simultaneously, music creation tools have become more accessible than ever before. The market for both professional and hobbyist hardware continues to thrive, from analogue synthesizers to MIDI controllers. Additionally, powerful free software including Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs), VST plugins, and sample libraries have dramatically lowered barriers to entry, empowering a new generation of creators. This democratisation of production tools has expanded the community of music makers, creating a need for platforms that genuinely support their creative journey.

**modmixx** addresses this gap by providing a dedicated space where music creators of all skill levels can share, experiment, and grow without the pressure of perfection or competition that characterises existing platforms. Unlike traditional social media that prioritises polished content and algorithmic visibility, modmixx fosters authentic creativity, collaboration, and experimentation.

The platform's focus on authentic creativity and community building creates natural opportunities for meaningful partnerships with the hardware and software brands that creators use daily. When users share their creative processes and the tools that enable their work, it builds genuine, trust-based connections between creators and the brands that support their journey.

With its emphasis on inclusivity and authentic connection, modmixx has the potential to evolve into a thriving, user-driven platform that truly empowers creators while establishing valuable partnerships that benefit the entire community.

### Colour Palette
![MVP Colour Palette](docs/images/design/modmixx-colour-palette.png)

**Primary Brand Colours:**
- **Yellow**: #FFD20B 
- **Orange**: #F3682C   
- **Pink**: #F82170 
- **Purple**: #B544D0

**Interface Colours:**
- **Background**: #FFFFFF (Clean white base)
- **Text**: #24343c (Charcoal black for readability)
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: 
  - #FFFCF0 (Pale cream)
  - #FEF6F2 (Soft peach) 
  - #FFF2F6 (Light pink)

**Design Approach:**
The interface emphasises clean white space and visual breathing room, with subtle pale gradient backgrounds in near off-white tones (#FFFCF0 → #FEF6F2 → #FFF2F6). This creates a way to introduce colour without overwhelming the user experience. Interactive elements feature vibrant orange-to-pink gradients with white text for clear call-to-action visibility, while maintaining accessibility and readability throughout.

*Note: The MVP colour palette is documented in detail, while the complete brand palette is maintained in CSS custom properties for consistent design system implementation and future development phases.*

## Accessibility

#### Colour Contrast & Visual Design

Accessibility was prioritised from the planning phase through implementation and testing. Colour contrast ratios were carefully evaluated and tested throughout the development process to ensure WCAG compliance.

**Planning Phase:**
- Colour contrast combinations were evaluated during design planning using WebAIM contrast checker
- Multiple contrast scenarios documented on Miro planning board with screenshots
- Accessibility considerations informed colour palette decisions from the start

**Implementation Phase:**
- Continuous contrast testing during development using eyedropper tools and WebAIM contrast checker
- Strategic design decisions made to enhance readability and user experience, including:
  - Hero overlay gradient with 70% opacity for sufficient background contrast
  - Gradient overlay prevents hero image from detracting attention from CTA buttons and headline
  - Text shadows and box shadows added to improve text legibility over images
  - White text on gradient overlays tested for contrast ratios

**Example - Hero Section Design Strategy:**
```css
/* Hero brand pink to orange gradient overlay for contrast enhancement */
.hero-gradient-overlay {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(248,33,112,0.7) 0%, rgba(243,104,44,0.7) 100%);
} 

/* Deep burgundy text shadow for enhanced readability */
.hero-text {
    text-shadow: 0px 3px 20px rgba(84, 6, 35); 
}

```

### Typography


**Primary Fonts:**
**Nunito** - Main body font, clean and highly readable
![Nunito](docs/images/design/google-font-nunito.png)

**Raleway** - Headlines and subheadings in bold weights for visual hierarchy
![Raleway](docs/images/design/google-font-raleway.png)

**Design Strategy:**
Both fonts were chosen for exceptional readability across devices and accessibility compliance. Raleway's versatile weight range (100-900) provides strong visual hierarchy for headlines and taglines, while Nunito ensures comfortable reading for body content.

## 5. Heroku Deployment & Hosting

### Important Heroku Considerations
**Performance Note:** Heroku Eco dynos "sleep" after 30 minutes of inactivity and require 10-15 seconds to "wake up" on first access. This is normal behaviour for free/low-cost hosting tiers and does not reflect the application's actual performance once active.

### Required Files
Ensure you have these files in your project root:

- **requirements.txt** - List of Python dependencies
- **Procfile** containing:
  ```
  web: gunicorn modmixx.wsgi
  ```
- **runtime.txt** containing:
  ```
  3.13
  ```
  _Note: Only the major.minor version (e.g., `3.13` not `3.13.0`)._


### 5.1 Heroku Account Setup
1. **Create Heroku account** at [heroku.com](https://heroku.com)
2. **Verify your email address**
3. **Complete account setup** 

### 5.2 Heroku CLI Installation & Setup
1. **Download Heroku CLI** from [devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
2. **Install following platform-specific instructions**:
   - **Windows**: Download installer and run
   - **macOS**: Use installer or `brew install heroku/brew/heroku`
   - **Linux**: Use package manager or snap
3. **Verify installation**:
```bash
heroku --version
```
4. **Login to Heroku**:
```bash
heroku login
# Follow the prompts to complete login
```

### 5.3 Deploy via Heroku Dashboard (Recommended if unfamiliar with Heroku)

### Create Heroku App
1. Log into your Heroku Dashboard at [dashboard.heroku.com](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)
2. Click **New** → **Create new app**
3. Enter app details:
   - App name: Must be unique (e.g., `your-project-name`)
   - Region: Choose closest to your users (US/Europe)
4. Click **Create app**

### Connect GitHub Repository
1. Go to **Deploy** tab in your Heroku app dashboard
2. Deployment method section: Click **GitHub**
3. Connect to GitHub:
   - Click **Connect to GitHub**
   - Authorise Heroku to access your GitHub account
4. Search for repository:
